# PersonalWebsite

I will slowly be upgrading this repo into a personal website, using the tools and knowledge I acquire from the bootcamp.

It will not be coding-specific--rather, it will be a true personal website which will also go into some depth about all of my activities.

For the purpose of assignment completion, I will be adding bootcamp assignments to my portfolio.

Please note that structure/content/style for all pages is incomplete.
